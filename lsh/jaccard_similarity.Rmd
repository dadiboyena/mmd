Find the set of 2-shingles for the "document":
ABRACADABRA
and also for the "document":
BRICABRAC
What is the Jaccard similarity between the two documents?

We know that Jaccard similarity for two sets x and y can be represented as:
$$ jac(x,y) = \frac{|x \cap y|}{|x \cup y|} $$

So we have to find the 2-shingle sets for each of the strings, then find the union and intersection of the two sets.

```{r engine='python'}
def two_shingle_set(x):
  return set(["%s%s" % (x[i], x[i+1]) for i in range(0,len(x) - 1)])
x = two_shingle_set("ABRACADABRA")
y = two_shingle_set("BRICABRAC")
print x
print y
print "Jaccard Similarity: %s/%s" % (len(x.intersection(y)),len(x.union(y)))
```
