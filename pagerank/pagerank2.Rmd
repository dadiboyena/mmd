Consider three webpages with the links as below.  
![Picture1](otc_pagerank3.gif)  
We are going to compute PageRank using Google's formulation based on Adjacency Matrix formation followed by power iteration till the values converge. We are also going to counter the problem of *dead ends* and *spider-traps* by using teleports with a $\beta$  value of 0.85.

**Adjacency Matrix**  
For finding the adjacency matrix, lets consider that there are *N* pages and page *j* has $\sf{d_{j}}$ outlinks. The matrix is then defined as  
$$ \sf{M_{ij}} = \frac{1}{|\sf{d_{j}}|}, when \space j\rightarrow i $$
$$ \sf{M_{ij}} = 0, when \space j\not\rightarrow i $$

Considering the provided page diagram links, page A has 1 link each to B and C, page B has 1 link to C and page C has 1 link to A. Thus, our adjacency matrix can be written as:
$$ M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1/2 & 0 & 0 \\
1/2 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right)\ $$

```{r}
# In R, The matrix content is filled along the columns by default, this behavior can be changed by toggling the inrow flag
M = matrix(c(0,0.5,0.5,0,0,1,1,0,0), nrow=3, ncol=3)
```

Lets also define the identity matrix that we will use, to consider random jumps scenario in order to deal with *dead end*. This can be written as:
$$ I = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1/3 \\
1/3 \\
1/3 \end{array} \right)\ $$

```{r}
I = matrix(c(1/3,1/3,1/3), nrow=3, ncol=1)
```  

As an exercise for understanding, lets construct the equations for each of the page ranks based on whats discussed above
a = .85c + .05a + .05b + .05c => .95a = .9b + .05c
b = .425a + .05a + .05b + .05c => .95b = .475a + .05c
c = .425a + .85b + .05a + .05b + .05c => .95c = .475a + .9b

We know that the page rank matrix can then be defined as
$$ A = \beta M + \frac{(1-\beta)}{N}I $$

```{r}
B = 0.85
N = 3
```

We can define initial set of r-vector as well. Remember that this set can take any values, as our eventual goal is to make them converge to specific values through power iteration.

$$ V = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 \\
1 \\
1 \end{array} \right)\ $$

```{r}
# We are defining V as a matrix to simplify calculations in R
V = matrix(c(1,1,1), nrow=3, ncol=1)
```

Now, all we have to do is recursively calculate the value of V until it converges
```{r}
repeat{
  Vold = V
  V = ((M*B) %*% V) + c(((1-B)/N)*I)
  if (all(Vold == V)){
    break
  }
}

V
```
