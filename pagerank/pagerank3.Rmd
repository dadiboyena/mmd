Consider three webpages with the links as below.  
![Picture1](otc_pagerank3.gif)  
We are going to compute PageRank using Google's formulation based on Adjacency Matrix formation followed by power iteration till the values converge. We are going to assume no "taxation", i.e. no teleports/random jumps.

**Adjacency Matrix**  
For finding the adjacency matrix, lets consider that there are *N* pages and page *j* has $\sf{d_{j}}$ outlinks. The matrix is then defined as  
$$ \sf{M_{ij}} = \frac{1}{|\sf{d_{j}}|}, when \space j\rightarrow i $$
$$ \sf{M_{ij}} = 0, when \space j\not\rightarrow i $$

Considering the provided page diagram links, page A has 1 link each to B and C, page B has 1 link to C and page C has 1 link to A. Thus, our adjacency matrix can be written as:
$$ M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1/2 & 0 & 0 \\
1/2 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right)\ $$

```{r}
# In R, The matrix content is filled along the columns by default, this behavior can be changed by toggling the inrow flag
M = matrix(c(0,0.5,0.5,0,0,1,1,0,0), nrow=3, ncol=3)
```

As an exercise for understanding, lets construct the equations for each of the page ranks based on whats discussed above  
a = c  
b = a/2  
c = a/2 + b

Lets now manually iterate with initial values of 1 for each of a, b, c  
Inserting these values in the equation we have for a, b and c we get the following iterations:  
a => 1 => 1   => 3/2 => 1   => 5/4  
b => 1 => 1/2 => 1/2 => 3/4 => 1/2  
c => 1 => 3/2 => 1   => 5/4 => 5/4 ...  

We can define initial set of r-vector as well. Remember that this set can take any values, as our eventual goal is to make them converge to specific values through power iteration.

$$ V = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 \\
1 \\
1 \end{array} \right)\ $$

```{r}
# We are defining V as a matrix to simplify calculations in R
V = matrix(c(1,1,1), nrow=3, ncol=1)
```

Let us examine what happens after 4 iterations
```{r}
for(i in 1:3){
  V = M %*% V
}
V
```

How about another iteration
```{r}
V = M %*% V
V
```

Finally, lets recursively calculate the value of V until it converges
```{r}
repeat{
  Vold = V
  V = M %*% V
  if (all(Vold == V)){
    break
  }
}

V
```
