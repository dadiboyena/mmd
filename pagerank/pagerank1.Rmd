Consider three webpages with the links as above.  
![Picture1](otc_pagerank1.gif)  
We are going to compute PageRank using Google's formulation based on Adjacency Matrix formation followed by power iteration till the values converge. We are also going to counter the problem of *dead end*, C being one in this case, by using teleports with a $\beta$  value of 0.7. An additional constraint that we will introduce to get definite output is that the sum of Pageranks of the three pages must be equal to 3.

**Adjacency Matrix**  
For finding the adjacency matrix, lets consider that there are *N* pages and page *j* has $\sf{d_{j}}$ outlinks. The matrix is then defined as  
$$ \sf{M_{ij}} = \frac{1}{|\sf{d_{j}}|}, when \space j\rightarrow i $$
$$ \sf{M_{ij}} = 0, when \space j\not\rightarrow i $$

Considering the provided page diagram links, page A has 1 link each to B and C, page B has 1 link to C and page C has 1 self link. Thus, our adjacency matrix can be written as:
$$ M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1/2 & 0 & 0 \\
1/2 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right)\ $$

```{r}
# In R, The matrix content is filled along the columns by default, this behavior can be changed by toggling the inrow flag
M = matrix(c(0,0.5,0.5,0,0,1,0,0,1), nrow=3, ncol=3)
```

Lets also define the identity matrix that we will use, to consider random jumps scenario in order to deal with *dead end*. This can be written as:
$$ I = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1/3 \\
1/3 \\
1/3 \end{array} \right)\ $$

```{r}
I = matrix(c(1/3,1/3,1/3), nrow=3, ncol=1)
```  

We know that the page rank matrix can then be defined as
$$ A = \beta M + \frac{(1-\beta)}{N}I $$

```{r}
B = 0.7
N = 3
```

We can define initial set of r-vector as well. Remember that this set can take any values, as our eventual goal is to make them converge to specific values through power iteration.

$$ V = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 \\
1 \\
1 \end{array} \right)\ $$

```{r}
# We are defining V as a matrix to simplify calculations in R
V = matrix(c(1,1,1), nrow=3, ncol=1)
```

Now, all we have to do is recursively calculate the value of V until it converges
```{r}
repeat{
  Vold = V
  V = ((M*B) %*% V) + c(((1-B)/N)*I)
  if (all(Vold == V)){
    break
  }
}

V
```
Now that we have the page ranks, let us also make sure that we satisfy the constraint of the sum of page ranks being 3. This is achieved by multiplying the ranks we got by 9.
```{r}
V*9
```
As expected, C is significantly higher ranked than the other two, owing to all the inlinks, followed by B and A.
